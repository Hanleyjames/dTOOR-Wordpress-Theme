    <h1>The Cyrcle Phone</h1>

    <div class="section num1">
      <h2>Unique phones for non-rectangular people</h2>
      <p>Cyrcle Phone is a unique phones company with a novel aesthetic design. Unlike other designer phones which repeat the same design, we had a mission to make mobile devices for women. The release builds were a huge success, crossing the boundaries of gender and age. We widened our scope and strive for inclusitivity. Our non-traditional phones feature a non-rectangular, round design. We believe this is perfect for those who don't consider themselves non-rectangular.</p>



      <h2>Our diy smartphone journey</h2>
      <p>Our Cyrcle Phone prototype had a successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1662021259/make-your-own-cyrcle-phone"><strong>Kickstarter campaign</strong></a>. We met our kickstarter goal and since then gaining incredible traction. We believe our unique smart phone design and concepts breathes fresh air in an otherwise drab market.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section num2">
      <h2>Unique phones, unique ideas.</h2>
      <p>The Cyrcle phone isn't your ordinary mobile device. We're building a unique experience missed by other kickstarter projects. We feel the need and want for a unique phone design has long since been neglected -- and we're answering the call! We look forward to raising the bar as the best curved phone on the market.</p>

  <div id="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
      <h3>Why are there no images of your new phone model?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>We are saving images of the phone for a week before the launche since we would like to keep our design uniquely our own. However, if you're interested in learning more you can explore our youtube channel or sign up for our mailing list.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      <h3>When is the CyrclePhone being launched?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>2018</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      <h3>What does 'non-rectangular' mean?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Anything that goes against convention(legally). Be different. Think outside of the rectangle.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      <h3>So, why a circle?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Rectangles, unlike circles, are man-made shapes. They don't occur naturally. Circles are ubiquitous in nature. They're cool. They're different. Plus they fit in your pocket with ease.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      <h3>What are the specifications for the CyrclePhone?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>They are LTE 4g Android phones, but for the same reasons mentioned in the first answer, we cannot disclose any more details about the phone at this time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      <h3>How can I find out more about the CyrclePhone?</h3>

    <div class="answer">
